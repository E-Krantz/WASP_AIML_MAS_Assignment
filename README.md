# Problem Description:
Develop a simulation of the human swarm exercise in a programming language of your choice. 
The simulation should reproduce the two positioning scenarios â€“ such as 
1. always position yourself between A and B and
2. always position yourself so that B is between A and yourself. 
Assume that the map is free of obstacles. Decision making of the agents must be strictly local. Analyse convergence and sensitivity of the swarm behaviour to different parameter settings, such as perception radius, heterogeneity of speed, etc.

Prepare a report documenting your model and simulator, the experiments that you ran and analysing the
simulation results (ca 2000 - 3000 words)
